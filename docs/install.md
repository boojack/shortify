# Self-hosting Slash with Docker

Slash is designed for self-hosting through Docker. No Docker expertise is required to launch your own instance. Just basic understanding of command line and networking.

## Requirements

The only requirement is a server with Docker installed.

## Docker Run

To deploy Slash using docker run, just one command is needed:

```bash
docker run -d --name slash --publish 5231:5231 --volume ~/.slash/:/var/opt/slash yourselfhosted/slash:latest
```

This will start Slash in the background and expose it on port `5231`. Data is stored in `~/.slash/`. You can customize the port and data directory.

## Upgrade

To upgrade Slash to latest version, stop and remove the old container first:

```bash
docker stop slash && docker rm slash
```

It's recommended but optional to backup database:

```bash
cp -r ~/.slash/slash_prod.db ~/.slash/slash_prod.db.bak
```

Then pull the latest image:

```bash
docker pull yourselfhosted/slash:latest
```

Finally, restart Slash by following the steps in [Docker Run](#docker-run).

# Self-hosting Slash with Docker Compose

## Requirements

The only requirement is a server with Docker installed.

## Docker Compose Run

Assume that docker compose is deployed in the `/opt/slash` directory

```bash
mkdir -p /opt/slash && cd /opt/slash
curl -#LO https://github.com/boojack/slash/raw/main/docker-compose.yml
docker compose up -d
```
This will start Slash in the background and expose it on port `5231`. Data is stored in Docker Volume `slash_slash`. You can customize the port and backup your volume.

## Upgrade

```bash
cd /opt/slash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```
